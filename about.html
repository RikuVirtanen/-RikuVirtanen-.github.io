            <h3>Football</h3>
            <p>I have played football from when I was 12 years old. Back then I used to practice three to four times a week and it was kind of intensive. Nowadays football has become more of a hobby and a more of a way to relax and steam off stress.</p>

            <h3>Discgolf</h3>
            <p>I started playing discgolf one year ago in the summer of 2019. Since then I have practiced a lot and became better and better in it. I like this sport because it's all in you and nobody else. You are the lone benefactor in your results.

            <h3>Guitar/music</h3>
            <p>I have been interested in music for all my life. At young age I started to sing with the music I listened to and later on I learned myself to play guitar. Now I have been playing guitar for seven years. When I started to play I practiced everyday but nowadays I play maybe one or two times a week. Music is still big part of my life and I couldn't think my life without it.</p>
