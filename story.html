            <h1>My story</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I was born in 1991 in a small village named Nummi-Pusula in South Finland but me and my family moved to Helsinki after a year. So you could say that I have lived almost my whole life in Helsinki or atleast in the Helsinki metropolitan area. My father was in the military and I got myself a military upbringing. We also lived five years in Santahamina which is a military settlement in Helsinki. I learned at early age to be proactive and the mentality to be always doing something to progress myself.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>I graduated from Vuosaari Highschool in 2010 and after that I served my  military service in Santahamina's military settlement. I got to the RUK officer school in Hamina and there I live for the 94 days. After I got released from my service I chose to stay and work in the military for a another year as platoons younger instructor.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>In 2012 I changed my workplace and got a place in It√§keskus K-Citymarket  department store. I worked there almost four years before I decided to go back to study. In K-Citymarket I got the opportunity to work as cashier, salesperson and in the logistics of the department store. </p>
            <hr>
            <p>After my time in K-Citymarket I had little trouble deciding my field of study but I landed on Hospitality industry. I graduated as Restonomi from Haaga-Helia in 2018. After that I worked in restaurant White Lady and in that time I got to the position of shift manager.After these years I decided to go back to school and stumbled in the field of Information technology business. I got accepted again in Haaga-Helia 2020.</p>
